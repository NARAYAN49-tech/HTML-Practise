The film was produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under the banner Arka Media Works. The film was produced in Tollywood, and was filmed in both Telugu and Tamil languages simultaneously. It features Prabhas in a dual role alongside Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah Bhatia, Ramya Krishna, Sathyaraj, Nassar, and Subbaraju. This film is the follow-up to Baahubali: The Beginning, serving as both a sequel and a prequel.[7] The film is set in medieval India and follows the sibling rivalry between Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallaladeva; the latter conspires against the former and has him killed by Kattappa. Years later, Amarendra's son returns to avenge his death.
